## C++ Primer Plus

This repo contains all the practice material and working exercises fully refactored
and hand-done by me with different logic here and there, and perhaps better
structuring than a beginner book can possibly go into.
Each chapter has incremental feature addition, typically lessons and idioms
taught in the previous chapters, with some quirks and idiosyncrasies carried
over from C itself.

Coming from a C background, C++ is a beast when it comes to features (I would
trade templates and other generic programming over C anyday), and I had
a blast writing in it. I hope this repo can be of help to someone, (if they can
find it first :') )

Lastly, _Stephen Prata_ is a magnificent author, each concept is laid out
very clearly yet with detail upto the point of exhaustion, hammering points until
you actually **get it**, all the while joking and making puns about _The Cat Who teaches
Weight Loss_ or the one that _teaches you C++_.

Have a great time coding (even my future self!) <3

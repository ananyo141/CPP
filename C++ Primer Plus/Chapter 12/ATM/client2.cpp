   5. The Bank of Heather has performed a study showing that ATM customers wonâ€™t
   wait more than one minute in line. Using the simulation from Listing 12.10, find a
   value for number of customers per hour that leads to an average wait time of one
   minute. (Use at least a 100-hour trial period.)

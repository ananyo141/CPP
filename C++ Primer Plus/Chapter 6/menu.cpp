3. Write a precursor to a menu-driven program.The program should display a menu
offering four choices, each labeled with a letter. If the user responds with a letter
other than one of the four valid choices, the program should prompt the user to
enter a valid response until the user complies.Then the program should use a
switch to select a simple action based on the userâ€™s selection.
